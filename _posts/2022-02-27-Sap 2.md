## Bidirectional Registers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59027621/148646875-0c3f072a-fa5a-4f66-a294-6c34c3b6b6af.png)

In SAP-1, instruction register needs 8 wires (seperate 4 wires for receiving 4 bit input data from bus, and seperate 4 wires for storing 4 bit output data into the bus)
In SAP-2, bidirectional registers are used which require 4 wires for both 4 bit input and output data. The I/O pins are connected internally. As both input data and output data are received/stored with the same 4 wires, less wire is used than SAP-1. hence less capacitance is produced and the circuit is also less complex than sap-1.

To reduce wiring capacitance of sap-02 we will run only one set of wires between each register and the bus. The input and output pins are shorted. Only one group of wires are connected to the bus.
During a computer run, either LOAD or ENABLE is active, but not both at the same time.
An active LOAD means a binary word flows from bus to register input. The output lines are floating.
An active ENABLE means a binary word flows from register to the bus. The input lines are floating.
The input output pins are connected shortly which reduces number of i/o pins and also the wiring capacitance. bidirectional means data can move either way.

## Memory Reference Instructions

Memory reference instruction(MRI) is one that uses the memory during the execution cycle. Memory reference instructions are relatively slow because they require more than one memory access during the instruction cycle. Furthermore, we often want to move data directly from one register to another not going through memory. MOV stands for move. It tells computer to move data from one register to another.

| Cycle | States | State Name |
| ----- | ------ | ---------- |
|       | T1     | Address    |
| Fetch | T2     | Increment  |
|       | T3     | Memory     |

## Hand Assemble

Hand assemble means to translate a source program to machine language program by hand rather than machine. Hand assemble the below program

```cpp
MVI A, 17H
MVI B, 2DH
ADD B
STA 5600H
INR A
MOV C,A
```

```
MVI A,00H
MVI B,0CH

## CALL & RET

CALL is the mnemonic for call the subroutine. A subroutine is a program stored in memory for possible use by various programs. Like finding sines, cosines, tangents, square roots etc. Every call instruction must include the starting address of the desired subroutine.

CALL 5000H

RET stands for return. It is used at the end of the subroutine. When CALL is executed automatically PC contents are stored in FFFEH and
FFFFH (last two memory locations). CALL is unconditional.

## HANDSHAKING

Handshaking is an interaction between a CPU and a peripheral device during an I/O data transfer. If input is told to be taken from port 01 then handshaking is must.

- Input from port 01 will not be taken until The LSB of port 2, also called the ready bit goes high.
- The time which is wasted to check the LSB of port 02 until it becomes high is called CPU waiting.
- LSB=1 of port 02 means input is available at port 01.
- After taking input from port 01, the 7th pin or acknowlegde bit (MSB) of port 4 goes high, automatically resettng the ready bit at port 02.
- ACK=1 of port 04 means "input is received", the message which is acknowlegded by keyboard encoder allowing it to reset the ready bit.
- And then the ACK bit gets reset.
- If again any input is available at port 01, the ready bit at port 02 goes high. Thus the process of handshaking continues.

<pre>
The sequence of SAP-2 handshaking:
i. READY bit goes high.
ii. Input the data from port 1.
iii. ACK bit goes high to reset the READY bit.
iv. Reset the ACK bit.
</pre>

Take a input from port 1 using handshaking.

```
AGAIN:  IN 02H
        ANI 01H
        JZ AGAIN    // input from port 02 is continuously taken until ready bit goes high.
        
        IN 01H      // after ready bit went high, input from port 01 is taken
        MOV B,A     // the value of accumulator would change so better store it to another register
        
        MVI A, 80H  // the ack bit goes high in order to give keyboard encoder the message that the input is received.
        OUT 04H
        
        MVI A, 00H  // the ack bit is reset.
        OUT 04H
        
        HLT
```

## T States

- Variable machine cycle.
- any register instruction takes 4 T states.
- any MRI takes 7 T states.
- JM/JZ/JNZ has T states of 10/7. 10 T states when jump occurs. 7 T states when jump does not occur.

- If all the output bits of the accumulator are sent to NOR gate, then the result of NOR gate is sent to zero flag. If all the pins were 0, output of NOR=1, otherwise in all cases output of NOR=0. so when NOR=1 and lf=1 only then the zero flag will be affected.
- The MSB of the accumulator is sent to AND gate with the other input Lf, if both are 1, the output of AND=1, meaning sign bit is high. So the Sign flag becomes 1.
- We get to know whether the flags are being affected or not from Lf pin. if Lf=0 zero flag and sign flag will not be affected, if Lf=1 both will be affected.

## Addressing modes

#### Direct addressing - LDA/STA/IN/OUT

#### Immediate addressing - MVI/ANI/ORI/XRI/CALL/JMP/JZ/JNZ/JM

#### Register addressing - ADD/SUB/INR/DCR/MOV/ANA/ORA/XRA

#### Implied addressing - CMA/RAR/RAL/RET
